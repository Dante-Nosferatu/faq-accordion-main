## My process
The way I came up with to do this project is to use 4 "details" for the topics covered in the challenge and images provided by the challenge itself.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox


### What I learned

In this project it was difficult for me to locate each element, but using flexbox is the best there is. I still need to learn how to use it better, but it is very useful.



### Continued development
I want to focus on knowing how to use flexbox, it's very useful
